### Environment management for the Polari-Platform-Angular app.

This application adheres to a specific scheme for it's environment files.
Specifically the environment file name for the frontend should be always be in the format:

                environment-{environment_name}.ts

Whenever the application runs, it is meant to run in a docker compose environment but you may also put together
a custom .sh file or a cli tool to run it.

When docker-compose compiles the app, it will look in our environment folder, check what pre-made-environment it is supposed to
be using, and then either create or 'overwrite' the environment.ts file inside of the container environment.

The app will always try to look for the environment.ts file
