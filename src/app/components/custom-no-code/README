### No-Code Components
The Polari Framework enables the abstraction of python classes wrapped by Polari to be used as
'states' that can be used to form a chain of logic via a no-code interface.

Within the No-Code Components we create a set of components which enable users to interact with
interfaces for using polari wrapped python objects to create 'state objects' that interconnect
with one another to form an overall 'No Code Solution'.

## No-Code Interface
Used to render a singular no-code solution.

## No-Code Menu
The No-Code menu is for managing adding new state templates to the no-code solution, 
establishing and tracking the basic configuration for the overall No-Code Solution.
Enabling Parallelization, distribution of how the solution should be run over different
machines, etc.

## No-Code State Instance
Used as the component template for rendering a component over a d3 state object being rendered 
in the d3 graph, where the component is specifically a generic state with an input Polari Wrapped
python object, which is used to define the State Instance's default configuration.  This can be further
refined down to just what is needed in the State Manager, making a specific kind of state tempalte.

## State Manager
Used for managing and manipulating a single 'State Object', so that we can have a more intuitive and focused
interface for manipulating singular state objects from an existing no-code-solution, or for manipulating/creating
template state objects that we expect to be common across many solutions.

## Slot
Used to render the UI that may conditionally be rendered for configuring a singular input/output slot.
