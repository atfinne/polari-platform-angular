## No-Code State Renderer Architecture

This document provides an abstract overview of the design and implementation of services and objects used in the No-Code State Renderer Manager for enabling rendering of D3 Model Layers and overlaying components on top of them.
Overview

The No-Code State Renderer Manager is a core service that manages the rendering of No-Code State Objects within a D3 Graph. It centralizes state and rendering logic, supporting modular, scalable, and reactive management of multiple D3 layers and overlays. This system is integral to both the No-Code Solution Editor and the No-Code State Editor.
Key Components

    D3ModelLayer Objects:
        Represent individual rendering layers for different types of shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles).
        Each D3ModelLayer encapsulates logic for rendering a specific shape type, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

    NoCodeState Objects:
        Define the state and attributes of individual elements in the No-Code Solution.
        Each NoCodeState is associated with a specific D3ModelLayer for rendering.

    NoCodeSolution Objects:
        Represent the broader context containing multiple NoCodeState objects and their corresponding D3ModelLayer instances.
        Support managing multiple solutions or states within a single application.

    Overlay Components:
        Components rendered on top of D3 layers to provide interactive functionality for NoCodeState objects.
        Managed via OverlayComponentService.
