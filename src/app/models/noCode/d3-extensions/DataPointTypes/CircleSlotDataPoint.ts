/*
        Sample Svg group for rendering a basic circle state object with no slots.
        Note that the order of the elements in the group is important for rendering.
        We recieve the data on the circle state shape first, then derive the inner component and bounding box.

            <circle class="circle-state" cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="blue"></circle>
