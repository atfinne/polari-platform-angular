### Class Editor Data Structure

The purpose of the class editor data structure is to enable those without in depth coding experience
to be able to create a class or data-structure as needed for development purposes that they can use
together with the no-code interfaces to perform development.

It can allow a user to define the variables for a class, the user may also choose to specify what the polytyping of the 
class looks like manually, or leave it undefined and allow the system to define it when test data is run through the system.

However, the Class Editor should always define whether certain variables are required, and it should also what the class
identifiers are that make it unique - if the class is something we are actually storing in the database and serving in APIs.
