### Class Poly-Typing Data Model

Poly typing is meant to be an adaptive typing model meant specifically for handling the data format coming from a Polari backend,
which is necessarily complex because it is meant to deal with auto-generating types and data structure for arbitrarily
complex research systems.

In simple terms polyTyping uses the class as the basis for typing, and then infers types based on data that gets put into the
instances of the class over time.

The polyTyping instance for the class records the different types and data-density that flows through the instances of the class
as well as recording relevant information for the typing and data density of variables.  

This way appropriate User Interfaces can be suggested, and appropriate and efficient database systems can be auto-generated
and configured.
